Please use the provided pom.xml and create a python script which customizes the project pom version to match this pattern `<version>ci_{git hub org name here}_{branch name here}-SNAPSHOT</version>`
 

## Python script requirements
 * It must validate the pom is syntactically correct
 * It must confirm the version is a snapshot prior to making any changes
 * The resulting pom version needs to match this format `ci_{git hub org name here}_{branch name here}-SNAPSHOT`
 * Unit tests are an added bonus
 * Execution within a docker container is an extra bonus
